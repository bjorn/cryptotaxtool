After two months of frantic development, I hereby present the initial version of
a new tool for calculating the capital gains made on crypto trades. Driven by
personal need, I had to take a detour from my usual projects...

## Some Background

When the tax authorities contacted me about declaring the capital gain income
related to trading cryptocurrencies, I already had a hunch that things could get
complicated. I had been trading on a number of exchanges that no longer exist,
traded crypto currencies that are no longer relevant and I have used many
differents wallets.

Numerous online tools exist today that make the job easier by importing
transactions from the blockchain or from popular exchanges. After trying out a
few of them though, I noticed several common issues:

* __They were slow.__ The browser isn't well known for creating efficient user
  interfaces, and even when just showing 25 transactions at a time they were
  laggy. Navigating over a 1000 transactions was very painful.

* __They were expensive.__ Once you reach over 1000 transactions, most of these
  services aren't cheap and generally have a yearly recurring plan.

* __They owned my data.__ They generally did not provide a way to export or
  import all the data I was putting into them. This creates a lock-in and makes
  it hard to understand the changes you make over time.

There were many other issues. I could only manage a single portfolio per
account. I ran into UI bugs and other strange behavior. It was impossible for me
to confidently declare my capital gain taxes using any of the services I tried.

## A New Tool was Born

The great thing about the services I tried was their friendly user interface. I
wanted that, but I also wanted it to be _fast_, _free_ and with the data _owned
by me_.

I also was looking for an excuse to start a project in
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and try out [Slint](https://slint.dev/).

I thought it would take a few weeks at most, but unfortunately it took over two
months. But now, I can present to you the initial release of Raccoin, yet
another crypto tax tool!

</div>

It loads a portfolio of over a 1000 transactions in a _split second_, is free _as
in freedom_ and you can simply keep your portfolios and all their data sources in
_a local git repository_.

Yet it still doesn't do many things that most people (including me) would need
from this kind of software:

* It can't yet download crypto currency price history on-demand (but it can be
  hard-coded to do so, so this shouldn't be too far away). The price history is
  necessary to calculate the gains on crypto to crypto trades, or when generally
  sending and receiving crypto.

* While it can sync Bitcoin, Ethereum and Stellar wallets, it is not possible to
  add these sources through the UI yet. The syncing also still hangs the UI,
  sometimes indefinitely.

* It only recognizes a static list of built-in currencies. It should really
  dynamically get the information, icons, etc. from CoinMarketCap and other
  sources (like for Ethereum tokens or Stellar assets).

* It thinks fiat means Euro. Yes, some work will be needed to make it work with
  other fiat currencies.

But it can only get better from here! If you see this and think it could work
for you, please don't hesitate to get in touch!
